The cottonwood was snowing

 I laid the back of my head into the grass

 I thought grass and I woke up with pollen on my eye

 I waited for the wind to come into my hair, lift it like a pile of leaves

 I waited for the white blossoms to stop around me

 I waited until I heard gravel crackling on the asphalt

 Walking back down the road, the shovel I dragged along left a scratch

 I felt the trees around me stabbing up reaching up all up

 For a second, the sky could be torn from the earth
