We’ve climbed up on the roof before,

 barefoot and shivering, at one time

 there were no empty rooms, so many people in

 the house, sounds of living and maybe

 even singing. A voice that wasn’t ours.

 We heard it then, under all those blazing stars

  

 I mean pixels. Screen glows from within,

 pulses in a waterfall, some kind of heartbeat

 when we finally get up to close the door

 when we do our homework after all these hours.

 My mother calls, I want to be right where you are,

 sleep, I love you, TV ruins your eyes.

  

 It’s 11 pm and death is on my mind,

 accidents upon accidents, blood and gore

 somewhere in the streets, she

 is the time passing and sick, invading dark

 people gone missing—could she have been?

 No, says my sister, but she’s young and has no power

  

 over things we can’t trust and things we can’t see.

 I’m young and have no power, am small, never win

 but I check the empty driveway, look up at the sky line

 inside, it’s my sister; outside, the lights and cars,

 and all I want are her footsteps upstairs, the shower

 running in the bathroom, her work clothes on the floor.

  

 I daydream of flashes and have visions of scars

 studding the roads, the bodies, my mother and flowers

 I left her, Fiji in the back seat and rosary beads

 I prophesy the petals tearing, stems breaking into the night

 as glass shatters the world and blends into her skin,

 she doesn’t pick up and I’m still watching the war

  

 footage from Iraq. Fallujah’s dust rises into towers

 and creates people out of nothing, I blink and start

 to think my eyes are deceiving me. Behind, my sister snores

 and listening I think that the roof would be cold by now, heat

 extinguished in the stars above the lamplights hanging, pinned.

 This is the part where we find out she dies.
