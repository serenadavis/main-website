How many steps does it take

 to reach the low green narrow-

  

 leaves which in a dream

 were slowly being devoured

  

 by cows and just a few sheep.

 The animals are not hungry

  

 grazing beside the wicker-

 chair porch, you reading and eating 

  

 a nectarine almost ripe.

 If we could use any of it

  

 our skulls would perforate,

  

 would feel filamental

 light braid itself through.

  

 The pasture is a lawn.

  

 Closely mowed it is

 a household linen,

 cushioned by sod,

  

 made toxic by rain, peppered

 by the wings of many insects.
