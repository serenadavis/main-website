  Then take the hard right where blue river reeds

 obscure the bank, waist-high, where the dock,

 that dumb, clean monk, has lost its red habit 

 to the current, limbs scoured by microbeads.

  

 “It really ain’t that hard, you just loop the line

 loose around the sticky bait, drip the knot in

 your mouth, and cinch, trap wire for yellow

 perch, that what your mouth is for,” he grinned.

  

 And that was what he said. What this shored mind fills in.

 Reaching back, my hand is fishing for the true 

 weight of his knife, warm, yellowed, and finds 

 a phone, no bars, the hollowed waters

  

 parting. Hungry go those who long after fish long

 after fish are gone, still, scale-silt, umber.
