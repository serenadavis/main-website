Introduce me first as a victory  
of grain measurement. ‘Here is a man made  
well, wheat flour packed without overflow.’  
Introduce me next as a miracle.  
‘At a dry desert wedding short of wine  
this man here is like a large stone jar filled  
to its stable brim with pure water turned  
to wine.’ Please introduce me thus, then turn  
and run, for like a young boxer fucking  
the judge before the big fight, like the judge  
with a gun but no pants, like a trespass  
or a good vigilante, I let law  
spill. Yes, I am force and in full force, both  
the fullness and the panic of measure.
