On this day of our choice

 we have collected

 at forests like

 some insect

 varietals

 beetling their way

 to the heart of

 the copse. We have

 coalesced for

 the moment as

 dewdrops do

 bivouac in the

 abdomen of leaves

 pooling tensility

 against atomizing

 sun or its reflection

 sprung from mica

 pieces studding

 the sharp loam.

 The tenderfooted

 will wince

 the shod shall

 advance this day

 of our choice when

 we pass separate

 through the wood

 to track in packs

 paths whose blaze

 is merely what

 we toss ahead.

 All hopes into

 mouths of our

 beer cans are fed

 crumpled jettisoned

 and come upon

 twenty yards

 down the trail

 as though left

 to augur for

 us there. But

 no other has

 before stood

 here with legs

 spread open as

 a pair of shears

 pin-stuck in the

 soil like sign

 of a miracle.

 Here the trees

 are deplumed

 limbs mangled

 and gray like

 stone jali hiding

 others gone other

 ways this day

 of our choosing

 foreshortened to

 evening already.

 No two paths

 cross and were

 they to they

 might as wires

 sparking this

 night of our

 choosing to fire

 but uncovering

 a charcoal plain

 across which we

 might see one

 another again.
