Music finds me twenty miles down silence

 Where I burrow almost

 Cruelly, there it enters

 The recesses I have cut, it says see this is just

 Like anywhere

 I can fill it

  

 I say thanks music you are

 The final touch

 As you also were the first

 But please not too much you draw me

 Out of myself and all I am

 Is you cheerful

  

 In your soil under my blade

 Leaking into the vessels

 You fill before they were ever

 Empty, you my body,

 I am greater I wrestle you

 Under the border

  

 Below which is not your kingdom

 Though you were born there:

 The way you fall there

 Is like remembering

 I like this and keep digging

  

 You do not mind

 And moonlit nights you raise

 Your watersnake head out of the lower kingdom

 Into yours, there you resemble me

 Double and quiet, sharp for there is

 Not much of you, making an eye

  

 Out of what you aren’t,

 Night’s inner face how

 Could it not examine you,

 Whitehead like bride’s hair

 In waves the color of waiting

 You wait expecting home

  

 And are gone

  

 And it is grander,

 Sky calling *stranger*,

 Waves you made uneasy

 In their stomachs, moon 

 That almost answered,

 Even I have to thank you: for your spilling

  

 As if into my eye’ s unlit

 Socket expanded it

 And in your passing I am cold

 And larger, and the sky

 Never held such memory,

 So empty a moment, such

 

Future to fill
