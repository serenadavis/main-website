To hear myself say it

 To listen to myself saying it to you

 Who listen, to them or who

 Cares why I said it 

 That I said it for a reason

 Or not, to you or not to you.

 When I said it I said it

 On the street, by the pier, in a city

 On the water.

 I said it in the forests

 Of America. A little songbird

 Who is frightened of the moon

 She hears me say it to you

 Who listen, I hear her

 Who hears me too.

 I don't think she listens 

 When I say it. 

 She sings to us the vowels

 In a sequence--ee, ah, oo, ay; ee, ah, oo, ay.

 Did Helen say it to Clytemnestra.

 Did Jack Spicer

 Overhear her say it to me.

 I believe what I hear

 In dreams, the people who speak

 From inside me in dreams

 Who whisper to me

 The whys and hows of saying 

 It to you. I cain't believe

 I said it to you.

 Are there any good poems 

 About saying it.

 If you find one let me know.
