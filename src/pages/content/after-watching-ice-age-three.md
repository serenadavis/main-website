To live as others do should have been easier,

 as easy as falling off the overhang

 of a slippery cliff, with help from a log.

 My tusks had been holding you up. I am sorry for it.

 The most dangerous place in the world

 is the world, or becomes the world

 after you have to flee into it. Even the cap

 of an acorn, or the wind-distributed promise

 of a future accord, will do, since all families are

 adoptive, or they are failed families, or they are both,

 as wind chimes need the wind

 to tell what they falsely believe to be “their own story”;

 the echoes in that cavern must also do justice

 to the last chipmunks on earth. They fell in love,

 delighting the birthday party, who saw it all

 last year (age median: eight and a half). We hold

 their hypothetical findings at a distance

 until we realize we are in there too,

 in the freezing not-quite-

 forever of an artificial-

 butter-and-paste-scented theater, where everything rings

 and nothing gets picked up, and you have to hunt

 your own critters if you want critters, to get out

 and then sneak back in with some help from that freaky invention

 your sister called “fire.” And that’s why we never came home.
