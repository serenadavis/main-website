2013,

  

 I

  

 on a dizzy morning in june 

 my eyes were rubbed against the view

        of that piazza 

 you should see those kaleidoscopes

 - even as a child of ten 

 i could never take my eyes off of them-

 for the very first time, as if in a dream

        i saw the reality;

 my beard grown out,

 and my voice cracking,

 and seeing 

 words could be tender

 no matter what

  

 i was thinking of those desks 

 those school desks dangling in my mind

        as like question marks 

 in those school days still capturing my mind

 and to those dangerous questions 

 we used to raise our hands 

 under the shadow of the rotten stringers 

 so many unanswered questions has left

 a couple thousands of us 

 trying to explain 

 the close range between innocence and rage:

 rage is cruel without innocence 

 innocence is submission

        without rage, said a man 

 (on his eyebrows there was blood and sand)

  

 on that morning 

 we had already burnt down the desks

 our kaleidoscopes were in pieces

  

 no rust left on the stringer

 no lies in our words

  

 II

  

 the day was booming.

 colosseum tumbling down

        for the very first time

 the earth was seen as it was:

 the surface split in two, 

 two different orchestras, earth in polyphony,

 one telling us kurt huber’s dead 

 the other playing shostakovic, the 7th symphony!

  

 On that very day 

 just like a dissident string

        breaking loose from a violin

 the city broke loose

        from the earth.
