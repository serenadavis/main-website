Sometimes, to avoid sadness, I ask 

 what I will think 

 when I know I am dying. 

 There, an orchid blooms

 and wilts. I wish 

 I had loved more people.

             Winds, preserve the shape 

of me, turns I make

 in the dark. I steer 

 thoughts through forests, 

 leave freight behind 

 that warehouse where my friend lives— 

 drawn into pages of directions, 

 his light-pencil. In his eyes, 

 traces of words: gray, faint, edgeless.

             They are for me. 

 Lay them out on the motionless

 river, walk with blue flame in mind 

 and give my friend my hand.
