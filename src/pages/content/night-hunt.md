Under the night’s maw the boar waits

 heaving black and bristled breath, night

 roils down the hillsides in heat spirals

 collecting in omnivorous dark the hours’

 end buffing night sounds and bating

 the mind’s early stillness. The ironwoods

 bend and whimper about bristling

 haunches rooting bristling roots of red

 clay white tusks between the shoulder

 blades of dogs behind a man borne down

 on scent wide across his broad back

 bulk of night cool on his thick neck

             Nascent light—here none—

 but the purpled hour like the dogs’ deep

 colored tongues still wet tremulous

 the boar still thrashing in the precipice

 raw gnarl of the tree vine and red flower

 the island’s gashes go boiling down

 its sides ashen-barked volcanic trees

 the boar barrels through the girls

 set on him their chorus of yells strains

 through the dark I wait the girls’

 shouts into the terse dawn the dark

 tree-throats relinquish the yawing

 clamor at the yellow dawn and light

 discerns the long ocean’s sweep.
