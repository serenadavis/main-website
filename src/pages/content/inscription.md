Things traced by what they trace: the flashlight,

 not the slingshot...as though to orbit was the point.

  

 As though going round and round reiterating

 were a form of argument; the way a globe is spun;

  

 the way, cleaving the air, the boomerang must zip

 whatever it unzipped, the carousel horse gallop

  

 idiotically to its tune, its smile painted on.

 As though a beat was an adventure. The insufficient margin.

  

 The margin in all things makes them too valuable to be

 any value at all, the inscription To Chester, from Wystan

  

 that surplus in the chastity, To Chester; a line

 ruining, by embodying it, its potential power;

  

 remembered looking forward, as though not one minute more

 on the planet won’t be, and it won’t be, the undoing

  

 of everything I did, the boomerang returning, its limit shot,

 From Wystan, its limit never met, the horizon near

  

 my body worn as a light sweater, something thrown on

 on a cold night, getting colder, near the end of summer.
