Someone smashed last

 week through the neighbor’s

 glass back door

 and stole his electric guitar.

  

 Or the mouse in the trap:

 Sweet crumb still sweetening

 between its teeth, and the whole

 history of its species, in

 attics, in grain sacks, in

  

 the golden ideal of the golden field.

  

 The way the sad child returns to his

 sad seat

 after sharpening his pencil.

  

 Or the newlyweds’ rowboat

 at the bottom of an ocean.

  

 And the woman on the front porch

 who keeps discarding things from her heart:

  

 The deathbed.  The divorce.  The friend

 in the restaurant

 in the booth near the window. The glass.

 The glare.  The impatience

  

 on her friend’s face as the friendship ended.

  

 Somewhere tonight a thief

 is attempting to play

 an electric guitar.

 The wolves have already worn

 a dark path in the grass around his house.

 They’ve

  

 not yet

 begun to howl.

 But they will howl:

  

 These great ambitions, slinking

 back one day

 through the mess they’ve made

 to return

 the infernal thing.
