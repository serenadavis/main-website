Depression—it’s a public feeling

 But what if I don’t like anything as much as I pretend to

  

 Darling Darling Darling

 What if I don’t even like you

  

 The blue night with trees

 Everything told me to feel something

  

 And yet everything you said was a lie

 And all my emotions were for nothing

  

 Oh all they want you to do is cry cry cry

 Cry they say Cry

  

 The animal takes the shape of the spirit

 And the I is no I

  

 Hardly on the girl

 But why?

  

 I had two main ideas

 That I brought to the forefront

  

 But the ideas never moved the audience

 To laughter, to pick the pockets

  

 So I tapped a little peacock

 With the fiery tail

  

 Until no one knew what was there

  


Sadness

It’s a public feeling

 

So I cry and cry

And the silver moon goes shining

 

Thunder and lightning

Thunder and lightning

 

I woke up in mid-morning

 

And it was all chatter

Just thunder and lightning
