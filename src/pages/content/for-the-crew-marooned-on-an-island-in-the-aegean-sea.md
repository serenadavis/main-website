At the chunk of rock  
               They moor their ship their only memory  
 It is noon the wind lies down  
               On the warm deck  
 And they gather the lots made of bone  
               Shuffle the playing cards  
 Chance arcs in by the mast  
               In the sound of the collapsing cards  
 The captain will not play the game  
               His daughter is different  
 Master of this place  
               Of measurement and particle  
 He will not let her at the foot of the rock  
               He would like to remain faithful to the instruments  
   
 Still the ship is moored  
               The island is crumbling into the sea  
 When light goes down the waves come up  
               Slip in under the netting  
 Watching through themselves  
               Under the pulsing stars she convokes the crew  
 Voice a rich mezzo she explains her calculations  
               Spilling over a train of papers in her hand  
 Crafted in ink with symmetric diagrams  
               Glossing over the blurred waves  
 There will be no wind for days she says  
               Only the lots will serve here  
 Only the bones the metacarpals  
               Still retain a sense of direction  
 The crew members must nod taken by  
               Her suite of equations her form her diction  
 The meeting is adjourned  
               And the captain unknowing does not observe  
 Later in his daughter’s tent  
               She hums keening music  
 She is hearing something else  
               Which filters down through dusk  
   
 The sound of birds tutoring their young  
               In the violet hew call  
 She is hearing rituals for pulling the sun  
               Passed down through the blood and sound  
 And she fixes the bones of the lot  
               Painting over unprotected cards  
 Shapes the many fingers of chance  
               With the sign of her death  
 She will not be wrong she has dedicated everything  
               To the density of water the statue of Archimedes the covenant with the dead  
 For the captain of the ship she will be  
               Agamemnon’s love in the Aegean  
   
 When morning comes pastel-blue and vaulting  
               She has already entered the fullness of it  
 Again the crew gathers but something is on their lips  
               The captain reaches for his lots  
 Casts the bones up into the blue  
               They hang suspended for a moment  
 Descend down into his fragile hands cupped  
               He throws his shock to the waves  
 Seizes the cards from his oarsman  
               Lays out the five symbols but they confirm it  
 His daughter will be left for the wind  
               To appease nothing some statue in the Acropolis  
 Mixing her body with the rock  
               The crew bursts into sound  
 Wind coming like white noise  
               Tone clusters mechanical voices waves piling up  
 Spilling out from air  
               Bones gaining heat  
 Turning white-hot radiating bodies  
               Now the explosion comes  
 A small bomb shatters them  
               Smoke hovers over  
 Plumes are what is left is  
               Time for them in the frames of the sea  
 The captain’s daughter died here on this rock  
               Has it been two thousand years for her
