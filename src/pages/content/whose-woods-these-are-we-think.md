When they ask “What are you working on now that the elements

 are finished” i say the elements are never finished; in China they

 have metal, in India they have ether, in the West we are short on

 time. Wood has also been named as an element. In Euro fairy

 tales, children are sent into the woods, probably the Black Forest,

 carrying baskets covered with cloth made by child laborers just as

 factories are beginning. When i first read the Frost snowy woods 

 piece as a desert child in the 60s, i experienced a calm as he enters 

 the whose woods these are he thinks he knows, though i didn’t 

 know that many woods in Tucson or a little horse thinking it queer 

 or a village. What would it have been like to be sent out with a 

 small covered basket if you were a peasant child into what we now 

 call the ecotone, the region between two environments— a marsh 

 with striped frogs for example— then on into the woods where a 

 peasant uprising is being planned. 

                      We have sent them all into the woods 

                      We have sent them all into the woods 

                      We have sent them all into the woods 

 & we know exactly whose thin logged-out woods these are. What

 do people need from poetry during the changes? The changes are 

 immeasurable. Perception, form, & material locked into the 

 invisible. Many need calm poetry, especially at weddings where 

 they feel uneasy, & i would certainly write that way if i believed 

 calm were key to any of it, but if what woods are left are lovely, 

 dark, deep, they are also oblique, obscure, magical, owned for 

 profit, full of fragile unnamed species, scarce on time, time that 

 barely exists though people base their lives on imagining it does. i 

 hoped to find some wisdom to send back to you & that is what i 

 am working on now, my present hopeful wild & unknown 

 friends…
