 Morning expands one rib at a time  
speaks through the pinktops of pines        On the porch  
I write to a friend whose mother has passed  
Blue fog is a doe that startles  
at my cough        I drink black water from its eye

   
This isn't about half-dreamt things  
The veil over the lake about to boil a man  
It's too quiet to answer anything but the tongue-colors  
of the east        fern-light slices from a mandoline

   
My words are bad acreage  
I think of taking my friend’s grief     for him holding it  
above my head & wading out     It is clear I can see the sand  
I tell myself this is helping    this is what the heart looks like working

   
Each step     the outbreath  
There is a boat & a man moving his line  
He’s throwing longer & longer threads  
to the still dark
