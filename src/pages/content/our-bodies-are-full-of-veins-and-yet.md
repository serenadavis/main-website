Our bodies are full of veins and yet   
we do not ever notice. The trees that came   
in a shower of red as we too felt   
the ground pushing up against us   
are now thrusting out and up and still   
we are pumped down as something else   
in us pushes to be out. A flock of birds   
growing dark on a branch are knobs   
of the tree, but softer, and when   
they startle, all at once, is it because   
something has flown up in our ribs   
and cannot move any further.   
The birds are always breaking and   
re-gathering. They land on the same   
tree again and again, and we cannot   
even stop looking. Before the warmth   
began to invade, I had already felt sleep   
being pushed out, the thick comfort   
of winter moving to make way for what,   
that peculiar terror that comes, when,   
having lived for years in a house not    
especially loved, someone wakes up   
to each of the vases gone, and finds   
herself instead in an orchard filled   
with crabapple trees. What’s worse   
is that the trees are beautiful.   
How can anyone who passes by them,   
singing, ignore them, those leaves   
thrumming into green, arching for the red   
buried in lips and palms, the color they cannot   
have until they are dying, and when   
your back grows with a cut I put   
my mouth on it. You are only the flight   
of blood in migration again and again   
and when I touch you I cannot disappear.   
It is not that we grow dimmer as night comes,   
but that colors converge, and only then   
do I know that there is nothing telling me   
who you are—not the sharp trees behind us,   
not the clearness of the bricks—with their colors,    
the way a boy passing by the river makes   
shadow animals with his hands and doesn’t   
even know where the light is coming from.   
He moves his thumb to make the wolf bite,   
then one creature breaks into two   
and they are both dancing, and when   
the boy goes home it’s not that he doesn’t   
notice the light on the trees is suddenly   
thicker but that he’s thinking of how   
the sound of the river could help him pretend   
to be underwater if only he closed his eyes,   
and each of the lights taste like nothing   
you or I have ever tasted. If only   
the light could remember voices,   
remember music pearling across leaves   
and breaking in the center of a grove   
of trees with bark inches rougher   
than any grain of our flesh, would it be   
as if we were there and again there,   
would the boy singing with his hands   
as he crosses the river at night know   
that music could never bring her back, but   
it can make them cry, and something   
might remember us, the way the grooves   
in the branches of the tree must   
remember, over and again, the dip   
under the weight of birds.
