 I am Marion Delgado. Amarillo ramp. We begin to notice gangs of women roaming about the city. I had

 forgotten that summer was an emotion. This is the stage of anti-imperialist struggle. Herons wading in the

 shallow water. My points are extended, their borders provisional. A great din at the ocean’s bottom.

 Patrick climbed into his Chinese drag. Memories of my mother’s mother. A specific tasted, like chewing a

 pencil. Tho it was too crowded to see the front of the bus, I could see the sun-illumined faces of the

 ramp. Rough squares had been cut from the seat cushions of the bus. We begin to notice gangs of

 they cooked dinner on Bolinas beach. Herons wading in the shallow water. Come Sunday morning, we

 bloom in fog. Patrick climbed into his Chinese drag. We begin to notice gangs of women roaming about

 the city. A tunnel under the river that would take you from Detroit to Canada. Memories of my mother’s

 mother. I had forgotten that summer was an emotion. Woman in a pink pantsuit, head tipped forward,

 asleep. A specific taste like chewing a pencil. This is the stage of anti-imperialist struggle. I am Marion

 Delgado. In the rear of the bus a man bottlenecked a guitar as two others wrestled silently in the aisle.

 Tho it was too crowded to see the front of the bus, I could see the sun-illumined faces of the boarders, the

 light in their hair, reflected on the inside of a window a few seats ahead of me. Herons wading in the

 shallow water. Amarillo ramp. Here is a question of truth in fiction. This means defining with precision

 every class and every sector within every class, and how each sector lines up at each stage in the

 struggle against imperialism. My points are extended, their borders provisional. We begin to notice gangs

 of women roaming about the city. My friends were all unhappy and confused over the pill, the diaphragm,

 and the I.U.D. This is not so complicated. A great din at the ocean’s bottom. I had forgotten that summer

 was an emotion. I am Marion Delgado. There was my life as a form of fact. Rough squares had been cut

 from the seat cushions of the bus. Patrick climbed into his Chinese drag. This is the stage of anti-

 imperialist struggle. Amarillo ramp. The fog burns off. She was a visitor. Memories of my mother’s mother.

 Herons wading in the shallow water. We begin to notice hangs of women roaming about the city. Able to

 apprehend the object of my perception. Trucks, cattle, dry grass, the moon in the morning sky. I am

 Marion Delgado. A specific taste, like chewing on a pencil. My points are extended, their borders are

 provisional. I had forgotten that summer was an emotion. Small speckled eggs. As the sun set they

 cooked dinner on Bolinas beach. Amarillo ramp. Tho it was too crowded to see the front of the bus, I

 could see the sun-illumined faces of the boarders, the light in their hair, reflected on the inside of a

 struggle. Woman asleep behind dark glasses. Come Sunday morning, we brunched in the cafes. We

 precision every class and every sector within every class, and how each sector lines up at each stage in

 the struggle against imperialism. Patrick climbed into his Chinese drag. Herons wading in the shallow

 water. Anyone with a bullhorn and a red armband was a leader. Calm, as tho stunned, we performed our

 functions. I had forgotten that summer was an emotion. Amarillo ram*p. This is not so complicated.

 Memories of my mother’s mother. My points are extended, their borders provisional. Fuck with fear.

 These flowers bloom in fog. I am Marion Delgado. This is the stage of anti-imperialist struggle. WE begin

 once, I tended to mix the various responses. Woman in a pink pantsuit, head tipped forward, asleep. We
