  *Day 1*

  

               A metaphor appeared,

      a form of action, while we were reading

 just below the trees. It made

               a human & nonhuman meaning....

        (*not sure what nonhuman meaning means*)

 So, here we are now.         Unknowing beauty among

      the brutal days.   All year they sat out

 reading, each to the other, in their skins.  Days

                                           of             drought in the west,

                             written    of.            Writers

     are stressed most            of             the time, trying

 with many forms                 of             life to make energy among.

               Dry months           of             people reading, greenshield

                lichen reading                       to the fence. Indicator

  species. Indicators              of             health, in the twilight

                                           of             a terrible year, *crepuscular*—

 a Stevens word.   Acts        of             gather & burn  (what now

         is called                       *the          undercommons*). Rosa Parks &

 Róża Luxemburg,                the           violence they endured

               amid                      the           infinite failures, unbearable

               if you read             the           histories.  To keep a little

  hope but how:                    the           young. Not to drown while

 trying to register                  the           forms of suffering beyond

               or in                      the           *the*, as Stevens wrote,

     the mixture of                  the           dump. To love, despite

               collapse,               the           life forms

               reading to             the           wood... frayed ends of

           days. Days in            the           mind. Wood mind. Science

        also  reading to            the           dream—

             ,    , , ,     , ,    , , , , ,

 ========================= (*log*)

 Some people think lichen looks dead but it is alive in its

 dismantling. Some call it moss. It doesn't matter what you call

 it.  Anything so radical & ordinary stands for something.

  

  

 *Day 2*

  

               A simile sets up space for you to doubt

            ever getting past the suffering...Rilke

      *Wer, wenn ich schriee, hörte mich denn* staying mostly

                        in his room          & where if they cried out,

                 *Who, if i cried out could hear* the children killed...

      A figure of destruction came to us & said,

 such admirable life forms on the street as if love

                 grew black threads... To be with friends

    you finally see, inside the grief year,

 class grief, race grief, loss of love & rain. Ruffle lichen

    spreading near the lake like similes.

                 (~i~ had not checked my phone...)

   We need to talk. Wood mind. It’s not just about your

 own little darling, the wife of the decomposers said...

                 Remember summer the poets

 read aloud inside their skin *where the undead meet the dead*

                   Voices sliced across the dusk,  black cilia,

                                             to            read to each other

 in beauty in the dusk.           to            see black-edged

 life forms on fences              to            lean against

                                                            ovals of energy

 while people said listen in the modest dusk,

                                             to            register the horror

                                 then     to            pass energy across.

 Cortex K+ yellow, medulla K-, KC+ red to orange,

    looks like punctuation while growing along, knowing

                 almost nothing, there are twin

                 sides to everything  & the beautiful

 wrong side is always listening...
