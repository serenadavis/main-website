 It was like

  

 palm trees in a line

 outside the building

  

 I catch my sight

 by: I get it

  

 and it goes. Girl

 overtakes me

  

 in her leopard coat.

 Angora guy

  

 sweeps up his zone.

 A river

  

 slides behind

 the palms, and the sound.

  

 I tune it all out

 too, each getting

  

 a rush in. I get

 the feeling grows.

  

  

 2

  

 I take

  

 my pill daily,

 and the days go by

  

 a curb. I leave

 to cross,

  

 now, to turn

 the one-way.

  

 Not memory:

 I wear the jacket

  

 new, hand-painted

 blue. All over

  

 it was like:

 always meet

  

 your next in fuss

 -free pomade.

  

 Few wear gloves

 in warm winter.

 He swayed

  

 as if he had me

 with his traps.

  

 It was just down

 to his face.

  

 When I inhaled

 the air of him

  

 I felt as if

 I’d only know.

  

 He was sweet

 when he talked.

  

 His mouth closed up.

 Orange pullover

  

 and a cling job.

 I came away,

  

 not even changed

 by the ripeness of his lips.

 In that office

  

 I saw a plant 

 so green it was like:

  

 I insist. Being

 nowhere else

  

 became its own

 effect. I lacked

  

 a window,

 so couldn’t

  

 let in a wind,

 couldn’t upgrade

  

 the moment to

 its movement as

  

 I would have it:

 my body, proven;

  

 the plant, hanging

 up and

  

  

 5

  

 shaken.

  

 It was like snow,

 unexpected.

  

 Temporary

 yes, but there

  

 I go, into it.

 There are beams

  

 between buildings

 so that support

  

  

 is some bird

 upon them.

  

 Parallel

 facility:

  

 I’m to say who.

 And don’t.

  

 As if the good

 it does to be good

  

  

 6

  

 for me now

  

 won’t fall apart.

 I see a bench

  

 on and on.

 Puffy boys

  

 will motion to

 the dirty birds

  

 it was like

 resistance

  

 to notice, so

 I did. And do,

  

 differentiating:

 the faster

  

 you go, the lighter

 it feels, car-wise,

  

 like memory.

 Because it was.
