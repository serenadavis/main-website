I wanted to know there was nothing.  
I kept knocking. When I touched  
the door with my palm the wood froze.  
When I called your name you slept behind  
drifts of rain for nine hours.  
There was snow in everything I spoke.  
Your eyes filled with the green paralysis of  
trees, months of wind at our lips.  
Please don’t worry. The bell  
that once rose from my throat  
in breath below you blurs into the night.  
I have less than I had when I first saw you.
