This is my body.

 This is my body.

 This is my body, help me hold it together. 

 Help me hold it together.

 Help me hold it in tight.

 Keep me from writing another

 tonight. You

  

 dumb piece of shit. You

 think I should think

 *brevity* is the soul of wit?

 Liar, lyre. Veins on fire.

 Wrapped round my body like piano wire.

  

 Oh I can’t count my fits 

 or the rest of my bits. 

 But it says on my lid

  

 that I come complete

 with scandals and beatz

 and sublime, ravine-ous, Venusian conceits.

  

 switch.

 *Satan broke his mirror when I came to you.*

 *I sent a list of everyone I wanna maim to you.*

 *And it was hot. But if it’s all the same to you,*

 *I’ve been put off by the feeling you’re a game to you.*

 *I’d effuse jagged flesh, leave my fame to you,*

 Wait.

 Was that a sigh, you

 depreciated fuck?

 Are my lines going nowhere? Am I too

 embarrassingly millenarian for 2014? I know I really should be scrubbing amnion’s tatters 

 with *this*

 till they shiiiine like the top of the Chrysler Building. Or

 is it that I seem...

 tame to you?

 Render me bread:

 I’ll pass the blame to you.

  

 switch.

 Oh, to be fecund,

 roiling, vast.

 I scan in Widener

 and poetry class.

 My skeleton’s shaking, 

 possessed of an ass. 

 *Enough* inked twice on my 

 biomass.

 In my unending quest

 to break* with the past

 * even, up, bad, ground,

    clean, and last

 I am going to dearticulate the joint between my tongue and throat.

  

 Comes break, on loping on long. Suds came armies on hot concrete: ticker feed. Ragged skinjob. 

 You should

 understand that you do non-trivial harm.

  

 *Temet nosce.*

 What art thou?

 -- Fuck, shit, ass, balls, 

 *ow, ow, ow.*
