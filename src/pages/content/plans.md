Their poor mothers’ white gloves on the waters.  Their desperate fathers, too.

 Their unborn children dressed

 in little unlaced shoes

 being read to from unwritten books in undecorated rooms.

  

 Shovelful of unfathomable. Crumbling castle of could have been.  So many prayers hanging from so many hooks.  So many unconscious flowers engulfed in hours

  

 swaying, saying pardon-moi, wearing

 fleshy halos, breathy crowns.

  

 And the butcher’s bloody little heaven

 in a hole.  The nurse unwinding and unwinding bandages upon bandages until

  

 nothing but bandages are left.

  

 A little gasp of laughter after that.

  

 An hourglass washed up by the sea.

 The soapy light of a late June afternoon. And the doves in the hedges

 like plans for the future.

  

 Those doves, such

 gentle, nervous guests, and—so polite.

  

 So let me ask you.  Now

 that we know what happened

 next:

  

 What did they have to hide

 and where did they hide it?
