 i am up to a rich

 work without ghosts—

 i absolutely cannot trust

 my follicles’ growth-in

  

 straight. i squint by

 the mirror, i grind

 my teeth, they clack wise at

 me, let me know.

  

 i am well versed in how

 water goes, whenever

 i may see a faucet. the sink

 cracks light and says *it’s*

 *the mirror.* the sink and

  

 i, really, are far nobler—we know

 only the thrill of making

 marks on the wall. lines,

 and the taking of them. the work of

 growing in—the sink

  

 laughs—focal lines dance

 in the creases, the all-over, i

 give it up. it warms me, and

 tastes sweet. fever, sweet—

  

 the light is harsh,

 linear. i have been standing

 here a long time. it is

 looking at myself grown

 down sharp, this light.

  

 it cuts narrow to me,

 bound to swell towards some

 eruption. my space to grow

 lines straight seems now

 a crack of the light. just.

  

 i believed i was arrogant. i cannot

 follow. i lay my eyes down

 the counter, flat.
