I tried, you know, I wanted to,

 I got a couple of volumes, three

 Or four, and I didn’t do

 Anything, years, so I rolled it

 Up and went, went and un-

 Rolled it, got to a friend,

 A warehouse, a treatise saying

 Years of goodbye, it went on.

 I tried to be over and of course,

 In vain, I found it, a shore,

 Completed it and it died,

 I mean something sticks, I did,

 Meanwhile sleep, you know,

 Drenched or silent, an ash

 Presented and taken away, years

 In that little wrong boat

 Gotten so that I might give

 With much and forever, nevertheless

 These things carried along
