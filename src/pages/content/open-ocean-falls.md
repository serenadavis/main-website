For S.P.—

  

 Open ocean

 falls closing into

 the white past dark blue

  

 where bound, in sand,

 in sun, blood, we lie

 unopened: five years

  

 of love – still

 it runs caught: every cell

 is a blue diver falling

  

 the volume under papyrus stretched,

 its inner face bathed as in tea –

 to look old? You look

 lived in, like home

                                        till

 the diver surfaces, volume

 unbinds – till the page

 cracks, read –

                              the ocean has never

 opened –

  

 the tea leaves its leaves

             (the waves turn over)

 the sea leaves and leaves

             (almost in sleep)

 we leave love
