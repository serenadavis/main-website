 one morning you will sense me 

 now, slipping like air

         through your incisors and lower

  

 lip. you might marvel at

 the intrusion soft 

        sound makes, a separation of

  

 flesh and bone for faint

 diffusion. you must find it

        easier to distinguish ocean

  

 from sky when there is mist

 between, the sort that blunts

        the precipice of a stark horizon,

  

 cuts across the seam where air 

 meets water perpendicular,

        curdling light into expanses

  

 of moist blossoms. when day breaks

 you may follow the gulls with

        your vision and find me

  

 adrift. then I shall leave you

 cleft, the way a strait brings 

        a city down to its knees.

  

 then again I might stray,

 hovering forwards, just how a ship

        unmoored floats ashore
