  Night yawns its dark

      door left ajar,

           and I declare nothing

  

 but this white intention

      to say goodnight

           clearly. This is clearly

  

 a manner of speaking 

      against but regrettably

           through this break-black,

  

 over-interpretative reek, 

      through this way of speaking,

           where *break* is consonant

  

 with *bleak*, through all 

      that’s left for us. Along

           with this goodnight,

  

 which reminds me, 

      there was no snow,

           is no snow this year.

  

 We cannot forget 

      to consult the pond.

           Not unlike your dreams,

  

 the pond is a magic, 

      the mirror of what’s

           fair, of creatures, of water

  

 cohering with water, as all

      above my head is how

           tonight now feels.

  

 Acrid clouds a black 

      shade of bleak. I shift

           my footing a tad

  

 and hope things change,

      and already

           you’re fast asleep.
