I. 

  

 Will I eat the rotting apple before me. 

 Is that why you left it, inclining toward 

  

 the blank-faced compass, oblique to 

 the violin missing a string in spilled 

  

 wine from the overturned chalice, 

 pooling at the chipped carapace 

  

 of a turtle. And whose skull is that, 

 also chipped, also slow on the cloth. 

  

 II. 

  

 Am I obliged of this cluster to pluck

 the fragile ones. Just as in the anatomy 

  

 of woman every station must have

 its briny tubes. Just as in the anatomy

  

 of choice every action need not have will 

 behind it which is to say choice does not 

  

 in the penumbra of utility 

 reveal preference. 

  

 III. 

  

 But I want to engage. Want to tell 

 you all I have learned about will 

  

 in the intervening years.

 If I peel the apple I can soak it in 

  

 vinegar, carve out a face and 

 leave it to dry in the sun. 

  

 Let it shrink into a head 

 swathed in the tablecloth

  

 shrouded in shouldness. 

 Perhaps it will remind me 

  

 of normativity. Or of

 the grace with which we used 

  

 to put one foot in front of the other 

 to walk or of the inertia that has since 

  

 filled in the roads around us. 

 Reminders, remainders, remedies— 

  

 have I solved your tangram, 

 did I play the right game, 

  

 my scarecrow is small but vain

  as I am—void, pour, *drain*—

  

 the difference is its flesh, 

 which is now preserved— 

  

 my scarecrow will remain

 on this table in this foyer 

  

 until you move it, which know- 

 ing you will be when you tear up

  

 a letter you believe you never 

 received. I will believe the same.
