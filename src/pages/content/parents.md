They tell the phone not to worry,

 they lock up the doors.

 Then, they tape mouth of the mailbox shut,

 thinking: who would write? There is nothing

 to write home about.

 The address is hard to remember.

  

 On weekends, they take walks.

 It helps them

 stay young, they say, and they forget

 what they meant, where they were.

 The house breathes out,

 the window rests its head 

 against the mountain

 they are climbing, opens up, swallows.  

 The nearby church rings its bells for dinner 

 and they eat bread on a bench.  

  

 She cooks by a dictionary.

 He watches television, grows a beard like a newspaper pile,

 he speaks very little. He throws the leftover pages

 at the cat. It walks away, its steps

 are stamps on the carpet.

  

 They go to sleep still dressed and with the radio on.

 It plays sad songs, then good ones,

 then the news, then it listens

 to the raucous laughter of late guests coming in,

 sitting on the upturned chairs by the table.

  

 After they leave, the window is unhinged 

 and the mountain

 can leap out again.
