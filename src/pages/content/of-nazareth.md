Land lies, not for use of self. Very slowly do

   
things vary. In some sense, rock breaks from  
rock to become other. In another sense, black

   
knowns are always moving to the unknown.  
Or skin. There are some places in this world

   
that are loved. And still other loves that are  
placed. There is this place and there is this love.

   
Here. Under the olive branch. Except for now,  
you have not yet pulled roadside in our descent.  
I passed the silence by eating dates, sucking slow

   
pits to spit each seed out lowered window and  
last pressing lone walnuts into defaced soft.  
This is not you pausing to pull self from

   
self to relieve. This is me in the car seeing  
you pool off and down. Dare me to speak  
of what lies, below. Of Mary coming

   
to the well, only to see her guards, as well  
as her angel. Each night, I remember every  
part of my body has been touched except

   
the inside. And I am inside. I am letting myself  
happen. As crows above turn quickening

   
berserk, taking flight over sky rising poppy  
petal. Now. You were there. Above. You

   
were there. Nazareth is waiting. Nazareth waits  
for no-one. I am still miles behind us, full

   
of wonder, at what palm each pit might become.
