Leaf carried

 left. Brittle-cold grass, where I want to insert

 first the asphalt, first the rain

 thawing on the brick. Silence unfolds

 its loud mutterings.

 Pierced by a cry. Black bird,

 yellowed beak. Not pierced,

 threaded. Bird finds the grain

 of the still air, slips a voice through

 and between the layers. First sees

 the layers. Soon the instant

 when the falling water is only

 what falls from branches, edge of

 gutter, off the leaves.

 Taps on the hard grass.

 New silence after

 this one. I plucked a smooth

 green needle from a low-hanging off-shoot,

 the branch leaning in to me as if to hear

 more clearly. Pulled bowstring.

 The needle: flexed it between two fingers,

 folding it in half. Pressed it between two teeth,

 convex side down, flattening its slight

 curvature. I would have closed my eyes

 to do it more carefully.
