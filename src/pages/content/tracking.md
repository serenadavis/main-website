Crocus, dark   
bulb starting a slim leaf,   
you hide your blade   
at your stomach.

Soon it will ease   
into dirt, a small tongue   
to kiss silt. A cut.

Love, I don’t have   
a grip on tenderness—   
those ruffed crests   
of pampas grass crush

in my hands.  I test   
red blades beneath:   
they slit gills along   
my fingers. I travel

from red edge to feathers,   
is this tender?  I can’t   
be sure.  I saw a goose   
swoop up. She left like

an adze wedged into   
wooden clouds. I stood,   
rooted. We decided   
to accept our luck,

the way a mare lowers   
her nose over a fence,   
parts shuttered lips:   
Here’s her overbite.

She clicks at slipped apples,   
her teeth close   
around fruit   
precisely as calipers;

although leaves are tapping   
against apples,   
and thrumming like bells   
through white fields.

Now this morning,   
after rain, when streets gleam   
like syrup, you   
are the woman who stretches,

tipping her chin back. Outside,   
dark arrows pass   
at the window.  Birds   
sound a quiver of distances.

Inside the room,   
light girds our two bodies   
like wire in a cloisonné bowl,   
glazed and separate enamels.
