Once the leaves had drained of chlorophyll,

 sculpted themselves with rouge

  

 and commissioned a warm light to gild them,

 a few threw themselves down

  

 to wash once more in this pooling

 of a water most unlike rain. And you

  

 cast yourself flat along the bodies

 of the leaves, made yourself expansive

  

 and did a wormy sort of work. Laying weight

 on the film tension of water over concrete 

  

 and gathering the leafscape to its boundaries.

 Where else might you bathe except numb

  

 in a place of your own making? The day, it went

 in serial: finding a torpor so passive

  

 as to ricochet: passion rises and falls on cue: crash

 and recovery pass in quickstep: then and done.

  

 So you’re in a new place, an unscripted space, here

 neither around nor along plotline, you’re loose

  

 and you’ve lost it. Far away someone

 is patting you, this hand lets its weight

  

 guide you gentle: far away 

 there is a place where dreams grow

  

 where they go round and quiet

 and come down from the trees you’d left 

  

 them in to find you and let you stroke

 their new teeth. You will maybe never go there.

 It is not a place where eyes go.
