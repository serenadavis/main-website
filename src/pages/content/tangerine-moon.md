 the avenue throws flat teeth at the moon:

 in the evening a single sided coin, indicating roundness,

 a tangerine phosphorescing in plastic bag.

  

 it is bagged, the moon, and the woman

 sighs against her crescent toed shoes

 while a thunderous shadow of teeth

  

 afflict the pitted moon, which the woman

 keeps in a pocket to save for the afternoon,

 swallowing pieces, spitting seeds.

  

 the artillery of the street batters her ears,

 hums against the weight of her tangerine

 and her moon, chatters her teeth, bears her heels

  

 along the flat avenue, which carries shreds

 of a confetti donkey lately bursted

 with chocolate coins papering the streets

  

 like dimes of gold leaf. she can feel

 her feet taking root, the artillery of cars

 pushing through the drums of her ears.

  

 she will become a gold statue, a daughter

 of midas, frozen throwing arm in midair

 to try and send some part of her self to the moon.
