A sonnet.  Eve was curious but bold.

 Adam wondered if the branch above

 could hold her.  He watched Eve’s body unfold

 above and touch the fruit.  “I think this fruit

  

 was made,” she said.  He once

 regretted her, so limber, not content

 to name.  Chaos of time and dance…

 Adam engaged to teach her to relent:

  

 “The stars, their motions false, untimely.  Earth

 is here.  The triangle has properties

 no matter what.  The mind too can give birth

 to number, natural law, mythology.”

  

 The will to teach was gone.  The pomegranate

 seeds were gone.  They were gone.  A sonnet.
