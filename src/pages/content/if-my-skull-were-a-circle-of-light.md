If my skull were a circle of light

 I would use it unfairly.

  

 After you were mesmerized

 I would place my tattoo,

  

 and setting you down, I’d

 read you what I am reading

  

 until you spoke it with me.

 Next, I’d take a long walk

  

 as the tides bring in the next

 waves of damaged fish woven in glowing polyps.

  

 To erase the record

 of any potential transaction

  

 I would make myself into a cherub

 and install myself back

  

 into the painting from which

 I think I arrived most recently.

  

 My book, which is the only one

 with much in it worth reading

  

 for your sake, doesn’t germinate

 in your abdomen. Don’t get excited.

  

 I’m the last cycle

 of a perpetual murmur,

  

 and my reasons are byzantine.

 These dealings in high wind,

  

 they break on the high rocks,

 and I couldn’t replace them if I tried.
