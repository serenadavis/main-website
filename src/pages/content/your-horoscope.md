Be brave today, thing made of flesh as you decay.

  

 Be kind and try

 to spend less money.  Try

 to avoid

 conflict with a Pisces

  

 in a parking lot

 at night.

  

 He might have a knife.

  

 Or, if you are not the type

 to find yourself arguing in a parking lot at night, try

 not to complain to the neighbors

  

 about the noise, for

 you may need those neighbors

 when the water heater explodes.  They

  

 may arrive with towels

 and buckets in your basement, just

  

 as you may find yourself

 on their front porch, bearing

 death’s casserole one warm morning in July, after

  

 the unthinkable.

 The Pisces.

 The parking lot. Their

  

 beautiful teenage boy, who

  

 even as a baby

 seemed afraid of nothing, listened

 to music too loud

  

 and to no advice.

  

 A whole

 sky full of stars

 reflected in his eyes

  

 as on the cool blank edge of a knife.
