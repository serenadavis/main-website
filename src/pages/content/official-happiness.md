The cosmonaut returned to Earth said moonshine

 was what he’d missed, and wurst. He described

 space: weightlessness feels nice, there is plenty

 of candy stuffed in the hatch-flap, et cetera

 and the kids think you’re a hero. You distract

 yourself with streets named after you, men in stiff-brimmed hats

 glinting their teeth and their brass buttons, jangling your hand…

  

 those thoughts are off the record. Asleep on the ceiling

 of someone’s utopian dream, the poster toddlers warble

 encouragements from rosebud mouths: Glory

 To Breastmilk, To the Countryside Electrified, To War

 Bonds and Corn and the bravery of slow

 animals who have no choice. Glory to your mom

 and the soldier who opened her like a fat clutch

  

 and closed her up again, tenderly

 and left for the front before you weaseled your

 wet red way out. The pipes of your *Stalinka*

 are still leaking sour water from the birthmark spreading

 its tea-colored mold across the white. Your life

 will be busy and short and in the end you’ll lose

 sensation in your legs. Two hundred million friends

 will weep as newscasters gasp platitudes

  

 in the imperial tongue. The birch trees creak and sway,

 creak and sway above the grove where the young

 pioneers of tomorrow will carry your corpse

 carnations, whistling The Motherland Hears,

 The Motherland Knows… Your last thought: Korolyov

 patting the pure white fuselage lovingly, grinning,

 “The bastards, they’re recording everything.”

  

  

 *  Stalinka: the colloquial name for a style of apartment building constructed in the Soviet Union

 between roughly 1935 and 1960.

 ** Korolyov: Sergei Pavlovich Korolyov (1907-1966), lead Soviet rocket engineer and designer

 of the Sputnik and Vostok spacecraft in the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Space Race in the 1950s and 60s.
