a sea beyond this world (what if

 there was (just a (fuzz

 of thought I had (imagination dead

 imagine (we’re told for untold ages to imagine

 the meaning of the world as folds

 and the beyond as folds

 over the elastic roll (of fold on fold (sss… sea

 (like that (still

 we imagine out of habit (yes-yes

 perhaps

 somewhere in the dark universe floating (floating?

 a sea?  (yes (fuzzy

 distant source, a watery uterus (no

 babbling (like abrasions

 profuse grooves (a speck of green

 in the sea of tranquility (floating like soft rock (as

 if you consider it too much                                                     

 the subject (which is your head (so to speak

 would crash down (like that (sss…sea

 just (a thought but

 it’s the spray at least (yes-yes

 in which I would be soaked

 promenading (this one as (a glossal mire

 the ordinary sea  (so  (moon-inclined

 tonguing and tongued  (this  (tongue

 tugged their boats where they pleased  (and I’ll breach

 kiss  (address  (tomorrow embrace

 the winsome distillate of your flesh

 so to speak (when everything is breached

 there’s nothing left to do  (boats move  (as a thousand grooves

 dazzling diagrams

 and only on those grooves

 can I survive  (imagine  (that

 the stinging surface (of my skin and

 beaded tears of  (semen that never  (poured into you

 are  (grooves

 as well (as the sounds at our death
