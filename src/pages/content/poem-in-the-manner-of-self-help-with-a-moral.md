  When encountering an emotion

 they say you should visualize

 it somewhere in your body

 I feel this spray of wild dill

 barely hanging on in a light breeze

 but it clanks too   like a tool chest

 I like listening to the geezers

 play chess and discuss

 Normal Mailer novels

 at the tiled table with folded up

 paper under one of its legs

 The man behind the counter

 toting skullcap and attitude

 I don’t know   he’s interesting

 I imagine myself so

 inexact by comparison

 I like the idea that I’m progressing

 spiritually   that I can maybe

 sit longer inside the uncertainties

 surrounding meaning

 I sit here because it feels

 like I’m not in the city

 like I could leave life early

 The loud types at the table

 in the back make it clear

 the world has nothing to teach them

 I could learn something

 from them too if I paid attention

 long enough   not that I will
