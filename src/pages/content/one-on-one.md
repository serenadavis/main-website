It is the nature of this game to want possession  
then to want to give it up  
to get it back so you can give it up again.

 Nobody stops to ponder the ball, the way John Keats  
pondered a cue ball’s “roundness,  
smoothness, volubility”: its joy in being hit.

 Imagine the score is tied, and I take the ball away  
In order to sketch it, or incorporate it  
 Into some kind of quasi-tribal dance routine... 

 I thought we had agreed to play. I thought you said  
We’d play and play all day, beating and being beaten,  
Taking turns at losing, learning its advantages 

 for a young man’s character, then changing fates.  
What kind of game is this, your going away forever,  
sending word, years later, that you’d died?
