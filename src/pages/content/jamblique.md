 For the sake of illustration I fall asleep and things change as

 I breathe them in, the walls becoming floors, the floors be-

 coming streets, the streets becoming fields, while various an-

 imals, startled, cautious, move warily up the hill and into the

 woods, where they revert to a prior state. ere are sometimes

 moments of calm arising in an imagination without the dis-

 cipline to embrace them. The animals all sense this. They

 stalk one another through the trees in order to demonstrate

 their most characteristic instincts. But these become detached

 from the bodies that house them, which huddle along the 

 circumference, or glide back and forth through small gaps in

 how they were made. Sounds fall to echoes, roughing out a

 zone where what one hears matches what one doesn’t hear,

 and adjusts to its shadow.
