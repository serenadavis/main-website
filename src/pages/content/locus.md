This collection of torches convulsing in ink: 

 it is not what I wanted to give you.

 All whites look older at night and yet 

 the tapestry has to include them… 

 I wanted you to sip this one swatch of light

 that stands singly, and 

 the tan peasant wind that catches and fans  

 the thin milk of its undergarment, and 

 how morning blood un-hasps 

 the hatches behind sleep’s cogs, flooding

 and the blasted furnace that risks ecstasis 

 according to…* Is this truly the color of my hands?* 

 I wanted to give you the searing first glance

 again, wanted you to grab and fold

 into that one swatch of cloth 

 and stay and raise your hands 

 and your children’s hands later when  

 I melt into cadenza and we waft hoarsily past these

 pinewood rafters, records of starlings—then

 till chance is at last served raw to stirring gods,

 till I can’t name the scent of any ripeness

 and no longer know what cool water means,

 I will needle my eyes into  

 the position of afterstars. I will make 

 light trip and sift off sandstone in  

 the quarries. We have witnessed

 too many rutilant past tenses.  

 Now I shall be the saver of pauses.

 We will need breath later.

 We erred. Sky should be easier.  

 I thought this would be different, this looking up. 

 I thought there would be a granary.
