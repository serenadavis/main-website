My city, hardly a city, still

 swimming like a newborn— 

 two winters into this dream

 the streets feel pale and distant.

 I made my room so clean last night

 I thought I might disappear, folding

 laundry until the space looked smaller

 like something out of a children’s book.

 Or like Meg’s window in the corner of the television.

 Or like an engine in reverse but heard

 through playback. Last night in the dark

 something seemed to give, so I scraped the salt-licked brick

 for the heat beneath. In the newer version of this dream

 everything is still red and distant

 and August finds bodies pressed to the street

 like too many petals collapsing. Each husk unearthed, unfolded

 in my two steady hands. My city, I am trying to write my way

 back to you, but out here I remember

 only echo or ghost. Or these hands

 shaking, all through the night.

 Even in the body each story ends

 outside of the body, and here in snowy Boston

 something is left buried. Easily, like broken glass. Like light

 bouncing off the sidewalk.
