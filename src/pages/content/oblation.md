It’s hot in the middle of the storm. It’s humid  
gray. Makes the dust bloat. I can hardly breathe in  
it, air moving too fast for me to hold onto, wind’s body  
swimming over mine. Like being in a room when all  
anyone wants is a little power over you, arms stroking  
against heads, black wide glass eyes darting, staying afloat...

 In dance class we are told to fall forward–  
hurtling our bodies ahead, asking to be caught  
by our selves once we get there. What I put forward as  
flesh gets pushed back by wind. Our bodies hurtle against  
each other, one risen from the sea, one made out  
of clay... Power is a series of erasures. You fall into it. You  
push against it. It pushes back. The wind is full of coyotes  
saying, saying –

 Some days, I say, I don’t think of it  
at all. I wake up having already been loved  
by the entrance of the day, the day that says come out  
now. The day that says the earth is your friend and you  
have a secret between you– it is your life. You walk out  
under the blue carpet of night and see planes migrating

 overhead, then a fountain, this magnolia tree, its pink  
fisted buds newly unclenched, dormancy beat open,  
pushing up against the seed-coat... Here we are,  
we did not ask to be woken, though it was not easy,  
not safe, we open as oblations on a dark branch,  
pink-veined luscious mouths drummed open by rain.  
A voice inked with water and wind rises. And the black  
loam beneath.
