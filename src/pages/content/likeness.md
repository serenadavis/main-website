           Talking feels canceled when I stand alone  
in the forest. Mother, your thinness is a letter  
to my worry. I watch you work in the garden.  
I confuse solitude with loneliness.  
My hair is also grey kisses at sundown.  
A doe strafes the ridgeline, until lost  
in the thicket, only snapping brush.

   
           God undressed in an arbor of madness;  
I am his mannequin’s shadow.  
My eyes empty the last clip of daylight  
into the forest, and quietly  
the rain on leaves leaves leaves clean.

   
           A son’s no thing but a map to likeness.  
You have tried to make me yours—  
I think of the bones you broke to bring me here.  
I promise, I am trying to love the world.  
Say it is not impossible. Place  
your flowers on the sill inside me.
