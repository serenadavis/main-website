  today I heard the capitol catch

 fire     like a burning bush

       all I could see were ground glass and

 sun      it was the FARC   I assume  since

 sendero is dead even though homes 

 in Lima still shine in a myelin

 sheath    insects on their  backs

   under tearing star

       at  least that is what I 

 see   from here      like a million 

 trembling stitches on a floor rug    

  

  

       I can also see capitalism     DOUBLE 

 JEOPARDY    and the answer:   What is

 trite         ca-pi-ta-lis-mo     I can hear

     it is a white sphere   so smooth

 I want to stroke   with

 vibrating fingertips    string it  

 onto a thread    wear it like a cross 

 perched always between my 

 breasts     keep it moist    screen its golden

 eyes from  the stubbled capitol

 shifting between relapse and   remission

         viscous black splotches wave from

 silvery column      physicians have

 diagnosed     so I’ve been told    the

 ailment        confusion of self and non-

 self       and are beginning administration  

 of a cure          oh   why do you keep  

 pulling at your scalp          lab coats always

 reminded me of Miraflores      of Dracula

 of mountains of lime

  

  

 once I threw two handfuls

 at my face       stood at the center of

 the highway at the foot of my home

 and almost thought I felt

 my heart    beat white      tightroping

 along the yellow painted line   I walked

 in silence until midnight 

  

      to my left waves fell   silhouettes

 of piled trash became far red hills

 and the road smelled of salt and beer 

      alive       you and I   looked

 at the world sideways and

 missed all the shapes I now see

    from above and below
