Not that we love order  
the skeleton but o –  
o if outside this room it  
carved up such fruits, such  
pulp between the beats –

  
And then the stretch of road  
we needed has been swallowed – still  
we turn, twisting our seatbelts at  
the neck, and point. The grey sky there  
is not the chaos we need to make  
*that* point and still the sun with  
uncanny execution acts  
its ancient orchestrations – “there are  
conductorless ensembles,” says  
the conductor, “that play so beautifully  
and yet I miss that hand and  
I wish–”  
          and do we need to wish?  
stamp speaking faces on a grid  
all blank arpeggiation, bright  
thoughtless precise  
display?  
              Then the sun  
too would have to speak  
clearly in a prologue to  
the grass *on cue you’ll die  
over and over* or else the grass  
did say the same  
at the same time or  
else a whistle-camera-pistol-  
-memo flown to all: *on cue you’ll live  
over and over and as well  
at your convenience die but that  
is not my area*

                                In the room the numbers  
                                attend their coming colors.  
                                The soft old man stands up.  
                                He holds a bass clarinet.  
                                He listens then he listens louder.
