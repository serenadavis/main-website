That the sequelae of  
 such love has no  
 such effect can’t change   
 a bit where here  
 we are in this  
 coarse mood swing’s doldrums.   
 Tense is the season  
 where time usurps a  
 ginger snap, tachycardia enlists  
 the wrong man to  
 the job of whatever  
 job this really is—  
 a flank of venison  
 that outputs offshoots erratically   
 in tempered limb drop.  
 I fake back pain  
 and conceive of highjinks  
 suited to the rondure  
 of a crystal lapis  
 conference umbrella. There, love,   
 the park menu awaits.  
 Chilly denizens of fairy  
 bedtime stories do breaststrokes  
 in the heat of  
 fair espousal, gender removal,   
 plus and minus bargaining.  
 You must not love  
 me now nor ever  
 again says the creatine  
 injection with suave inflection.   
   
 Denuded for the evening,  
 suffering Bell’s Palsy, honored  
 by the draping hard-on  
 in the wind’s backtalk,  
 we settle up our  
 score and make way  
 on immobile yachts high  
 above the derby tides.  
 You move with prolix  
 spasms, inflated misdemeanors, even  
 a ringlet of pewter  
 that you place in  
 glass ashtrays for mother.  
 Today and tomorrow are  
 not polyandrous—in fact  
 suffrage comes in bins  
 on liners from token  
 deposits of a rough  
 Neanderthal mandarin. Oranges. Stencil   
 stashes. Sigh. Exhale. Scoop  
 the muscle tissue contraction  
 that has too its  
 Indo-European roots—we  
 all do, you know.  
 We all do. Yet  
 love has channeled the  
 age’s decorum into a  
 rare late-hour affect.  
 Pudgy bottom trawlers, all  
 of us and them.  
 When was it one  
 first heard the spray  
 at the back of  
 the throat that clicked  
 its graceshaped cap in  
 some kind of rhomboidal  
 romp? I don’t know.  
 O, verily, I don’t.  
 BP has continued setting  
   
 out its continued commitment  
 to environmental restoration efforts   
 in the Gulf region  
 despite the company’s legal   
 challenge to the misinterpretation  
 of the settlement’s agreement  
 with the Plaintiffs’ Steering   
 Committee. Arousal. Keystone Light.   
 Flick me with the  
 teeth of your smile  
 in the patchy dust  
 rigger you call home  
 my positive legacy love.  
 From small denomination bills  
 a wad is born.  
 And, your Highness, to  
 my utter amazement’s grotesque   
 patience, at least $4  
 billion donations a year  
 await gas development plans.  
 It’s Labor Day, 1935.  
 A tropical cyclone plunks  
 down its bushy arms  
 in Floridian climes, alas.  
 A flood burgeons its  
 safe bet, breaks its  
 belt, a statewide panic  
 claims anonymous residents lost  
 in their casual historicity.  
 Fire. Tornado outbreak. Exploitation.   
 Silicosis at Coconut Grove.   
 Explosion in Texas City.  
 Dam failure: Santa Clarita.  
 You can keep stemming  
 the laundry lists of  
 American disasters privately, which  
 is to say morosely,  
   
 or you can do  
 so in this poem  
 and be judged for  
 it—rightly?—I think.  
 USS *Indianapolis* goes  
 down—near Guam—direct  
 action (military)—drowning, shark  
  attack, hypothermia, 879 people  
 taken. The conceit is  
 plain, now, it exists  
 on a plain now.  
 A plane called Now.  
 Part of the tragedy  
 of dying in a  
 tragedy is losing one’s  
 dignity, one’s right to  
 personal, exclusive mourning—a  
 myth, yes, but one  
 we’d like not to  
 have robbed in front  
 of our very faces.  
 Rubbed out, the smokestack  
 plantation mill burned down  
 in the mudslide with  
 surprising caution, the witnesses,   
 onlookers, townsfolk, germs. Considerate.   
 It’s time. That terrible  
 time again. The scene  
 in the movie where  
 they must go and  
 part—and we’re not  
 even really sure the  
 tenuity of their... Bored  
 people are cruel because  
 now comes the momentum  
 of last resort. Hell  
 and habitude incurred by  
 salesgirls with failed aplomb,  
 pulling, milling, mulling, pilling.  
   
 I try to get  
 you to talk to  
 me and prop you  
 up and stuff you  
 with projected imagined speech.   
 The charming part is  
 you do not speak  
 even then what I  
 want you to—and  
 this is called something.  
 Junior jurors run away.  
 The fact seems to  
 be, however, a bullet—  
 a heart attack, company  
 dinners, unrelated fifteenths trying   
 to begin the enterprise  
 quite. Too many call  
 this something—this resort—  
 I try to get  
 even then what I—  
 resilient green and shaky  
 the lives lengthen custodial  
 bliss, worthwhile forays, unsaid.   
 Like the Jewish homosexuals  
 in Proust, we were  
 poison-ivy heroes, forgotten  
 on outer limits, played  
 badly by cameo Demerol   
 memorials. Is it right  
 for the dim vision  
 before me to salute  
 the end of my  
 qualities with a glass  
 of gin? Sometimes, your  
 voice, an imitation, a  
 thing said, a point,  
 is enough to let  
 gentle nature have its  
 most ungentle way. The  
   
 thriller is ending.  
 The thriller has ended.  
 The thrills are gone.  
 Most profound and subtle sense   
 be with me, tonight—  
 my love has evacuated  
 their sentimental fluids in   
 borrowed clothes from another   
 generation—one I hear  
 about so often, never  
 see, and this makes  
 me very lonely, depraved,   
 abject, foregone, a wasp  
 and wisp and gasp  
 with lisp. The cusp  
 of my love is  
 love, I think. A  
 kind of Calvinism in  
 reverse, if you think  
 about it. Love, goodnight.
