To my amazement, someone is dancing.  
Eternal Biedermeier, the sound of windshield wipers  
Lulling the car, making of the rain  
A beloved shape-shift deeply, my sister’s  
Charm bracelet on the wheel rhyming “Ramapo”

   
With “Brahms’ Alto”, the sound is stronger than hills  
Yielding to facts. This is my poem,  
A paean to dementia. This embraces  
Dementia. The rain conceals a little,  
Then is wiped away. The next exit

   
Toys with the undercarriage gently.  
Rain makes a gorgeous pattern on the glass.  
Let us begin: we are driving in the rain.  
Rampant, redoubled, sister and I see  
The rain so beautiful and then an empty

   
Windshield equally deathless, dazzling  
Winter bees with a mountain on each wing.  
By noon, nothing remains but romantic litter.  
Biedermeier at all the outposts beats,  
Whirrs, thuds. One charm upon her bracelet

   
Rings my eye with emerald around.  
The first word of the risen Christ was “Woman”.  
Did Magdalene require a further word?  
Is there a forgotten country, *un pays vague,*  
Behind the vexed and uxorious country

   
Forgotten just now? Litter of rain,  
Little winter birds suggest as much. The aftermath  
Of Bellerophon was olive groves. But see:  
The shadows of olive trees turn instantly  
To water. Waves of light, in a concourse

   
Of silver hyphens, drench new patterns of herbs  
Near to home. Home is a southern studio.  
Mother dotes upon the downing moon.  
My sister drives a Biedermeier toy.  
To my amazement, someone is dancing.
