I can come but still I cannot meditate.  
Before these months, when I saw a bathtub,  
I did not dare lie down inside of it,  
knowing I might begin to dream of physical  
cloud and epidermis, and come apart  
as completely as I had dreamed.  
As I had feared. So many sensations.  
But you know, I tried this last night,  
as I went through my meticulous list of  
trying, top to bottom. I lit the expensive  
candle on the windowsill naked in  
my bathroom and admired the stained  
marble, and thought of all the things  
I was afraid to forget, but could not  
know them, nor find reason, and when  
in the morning my mother came in  
exclaiming she smelled the candle,  
I said I did not. For this is how,  
whatever is apparent to you I do not see.  
While the white scented body of wax  
was slow waning there was no pleasant  
smell, or any smell at all, only  
the self in the throat, slowly diminishing.
