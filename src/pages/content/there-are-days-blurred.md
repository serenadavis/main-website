There are days blurred like the skin  
of fruit rotting, when we look into the water  
and cannot tell if the dark stripes  
shuddering over the surface  
are the reflections of street lamps  
or just our shadows. Such days  
do not have matching nights, unless  
they are white nights, but then  
each night is crossed out  
 by the black stroke of a morning  
 where a dead man lies on a table,  
 already a stranger, like a  
simple object at which a child  
peers through a rolled up notebook page,  
 willing it further and further away.  
 You wake and press your face  
 to the plaster, folding your hands  
on your lap, your starched sheet,  
a prayer passing from your cheek  
to the wallpaper. No, you are not  
God’s favorite doll. We open and close  
our eyes for Him dutifully, but He  
only uses us for our ability to forget.
