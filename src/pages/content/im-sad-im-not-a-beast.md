*After the poem of the same name by Alexander Vvedensky* I’m sad I’m not a beast

 asprint down some blue lane

 whispering confidences to my

  

        self : let’s wait a little

        we’ll go walk in the woods with you

        to gawk at the paltry leaves

  

 I wish I were a star

 running seeking that one nest

 to drown in – none

 could hear that star making creakings

 to embolden the silence of fish

  

        I have a complaint

        : I’m not a rug , nor a hydrangea

  

 I’m sad I’m not a roof

 falling – little by little – in

 for whom death is only a moment

 wet with rain

  

        I dislike that I’m mortal

        I’m sad I’m inexact

  

 I’m sad I’m not a chalice

 I hate that I’m not pity

 I’m not even a copse

 that sheathes itself with leaves

  

        It’s hard to be with the minutes

        Who have wasted me so badly

  

        It’s terribly offensive to me

        That I’m visible currently

  

 It’s awful to me that I move

 not at all like a worm

 The worm rips burrows into

 the earth and plants conversations

  

        Earth , where are your works

  

 the cold worm says to her

 and Earth , disposing of the dead

 , keeps quiet

  

        ( she knows it’s not like that )

  

 I’m scared I have before me

 two identical things

 I don’t see how they’re different

 how each one lives , independent

  

 I’m scared I have before me

 two identical things

 I don’t see how eager they are

 to look like one another

  

        We’re sitting with you , wind

        atop this deathly pebble

  

 and here , at the tip of the letter

 I put down the word *box*

 I set *box* in its place

 : its substance is thick dough

  

        I don’t like that I’m mortal

        I’m sad I’m inexact

  

        I still have a complaint

        : I’m not a rug , nor a hydrangea

  

 we’ll go walk in the woods with you

 to gawk at the paltry leaves . . .

 I’m sad that on those leaves

 I won’t see the unnoticed words

  

        called : instance , called : immortality

        called : view from the beginning

  

 I’m scared I’m not an eagle

 I’m sad I’m not a seed

 The worm crawls over all

 He bears monotony

  

 I’m scared that I’m unknown

 I’m sorry I’m not flame
