Cypress scepters in the rocks, paint-green water 

 crept like shadows about our feet. Swallows 

 ricocheting overhead in aimless cursive like the 

 accident of evolution, the calligraphy of the 

 wind. An evening is like a postcard so easy to 

 cherish. The easy memories. The familiar 

 grooves, well-worn, my vision slides into. 

 Where are those buried ones, the dusted with 

 forgetfulness? There, the untrodden soil 

 unstamped by the wheels, still loose about the 

 fingers. The time I was nine I told my parents 

 every once in a while a moment comes and I 

 know I am really alive again, I exist and I know 

 it and it is as though I have been unaware all 

 this time and there arrives a second so vivid 

 suddenly and they said are you okay I get taken 

 to the hospital they sticker wires to my head and 

 told me sleep why couldn’t that be beautiful. 

 Why couldn’t we resist. Wherefore did the 

 anxiety arise like dew, indiscriminate. You 

 couldn’t forget this now, though the spines 

 would crack like whips and the spells would 

 pass and the results were inconclusive and we 

 all just lived with the symptoms, symptoms of 

 nothing like your fabric flowers. The 

 arrangement we outlived. The water we could 

 not, the fire we could the scissors we could not, 

 take me those geraniums break me the cassettes. 

 Slurp me like a spool and pin me by my neck. 

 The flowerbeds, the furrows were ordained.
