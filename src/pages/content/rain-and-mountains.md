Sitting on a ledge,

 observing the landscape

 below, she admires

 the proportional

 beauty

  

  

 of the sycamores,

 spires, and greens,

 but the air smells ornery,

 and she is distracted

 by a vibration.

  

  

 She wants to wash

 her hands but cannot.

 All things might

 change but do not.

 Plagued by uneasy thoughts,

  

  

 she wishes she’d

 taken the drugs.

 It’s as if her head were

 partially blown off.

 Who will find her?

  

  

 The view across

 the valley reveals

 an electrical storm coming in,

 squeezing the clouds,

 tearing them asunder.

  

  

 Long ago,

 her parents nuzzled her,

 murmuring, My love,

 but now her eyes

 are salt-choked,

  

  

 and a fragrance

 blows from the river,

 as daylight topples over,

 darkness coming

 suddenly in the North.
