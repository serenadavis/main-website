Few understood the fire
and no one warned those
who walked toward it
or the spectators that gathered
on rooftops and balconies to watch
the wind carry it in dull waves
 
Every light becomes a celebration
at night when time worn thin
rips under the weight of measuring hands
 
The beams and walls of houses
now diminished outlines
left open welcoming late guests
 
Around the fire pit
the air regains its shape
and rests a heavy coat
the relief when darkness gives you warmth
and in its hold there is no need 
 
To be seen a shadow or a body
