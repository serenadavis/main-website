 scape’s chance,  
the penny cool in the middle of your

 otherwise

 chaotic  
palm, all creases dashing as

 they’ve dashed

 since you  
were born, darling, I’m sure of

 it, I know

 the science,  
have watched enough babies’

 hands grow

 into debtors  
handing me due bronze (copper-tin) coins to

 know those lines

 aren’t going  
anywhere. Lawless as ever, they’re

 yours. Do you hear

 that? It’s raining  
bronze in this, my medallion city. Vegas.

 Old Clark

 County. I built  
The Riviera with pennies stacked

 Lincolns on

 Lincolns just  
like the one you have there, though

 my Lincolns

 never have  
a scar on their cheek never tar

 over LIBERTY’s

 Y God no  
my Lincolns are always fresh, well

 rested &

       eager to  
be stacked into my tall jutty

 gleaming

 Palace. It’s  
2018 & people like you are coming from

 all over

 to try to game  
a piece of your own palace, to win

 & win a

 new life. But  
I win. Every time. Lives & lives.

 With out-

 stretched  
arms you give me everything

 but the thin

 debossed  
lines breaking in arches across

 your empty

 palms. Be  
calm. I am sparing you. Keep

 your penny.

 Keep this  
glinting instressed relic

 of your time.
