 Was it noble,

 The bitter austerity of desire

  

 Opposing

 Viol to cello, rampant to redoubled

  

 Free animals,

 Phaedrus a litter of souls coupled

  

 Eternally?

 There was a hillside farm, a steep one. I saw it.

  

 It was slow to

 Perish, floating in a mist of white bees.

  

 Then later,

 My face became strange to me.

  

 The world also.

 Charioteer of wounds and bleeding,

  

 What herbs might help

 My dead beneath the bright wheels of thousands

  

 Of you? Wild thyme

 Was a man once. The upshot and noon inclined

  

 To apogee,

 The higher still as early Magdalene.
