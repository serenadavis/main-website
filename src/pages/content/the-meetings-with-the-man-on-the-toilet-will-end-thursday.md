It is the right of the student to leave his shoes 

 outside the bathroom for the man himself squats barefoot.  

 In the mornings the man finishes another book, orders his milk,

 and when the milkman comes to fetch his tip,

  

 it is the right of the student

 who has forgotten the money again to ask for forgiveness. 

 It is forgiveness that trembles in the open

 window and the open window that 

  

 cries out to the world outside the bathroom

 of the twenty-fourth floor

 where the mirror is turned 

 upside down on the floor

  

 to support Picasso’s “Prophet holding a baby owl.”

 In the bathroom,

 it is Picasso who proffers the soap bar. In the bathroom, 

 the student and the man talk little, drink milk,

  

 listen to the marionettes for it is winter, 

 and finally come to the conclusion that there will never be

 anything of substance to argue about, and so

 the meetings with the man on the toilet will end. It is Thursday. 

  

 It is the right of the student to leave the bathroom at this point. 

 At this point the man will stand up 

 from his seat, flush, wash, sigh.

 The milkman will himself choose to take a rain check,

  

 The student will, as is his right, mention to his mother

 the name of the man with whom he has spent

 his mornings, and his mother will lament to the church. 

 The mirror will be newly hung 

  

 on the wall opposite the window,

 and as the snow nestles into the cracks of the 

 lonely apartment, a voice will 

 be heard on the telephone, sullen but crisp,

 answering the questions it has posed to itself.
