Eelgrass flowing from the surface of the ocean

 like the sea’s aqueous mane,

 threaded gold

 waving at each swell of tide

 now and then

 separated as though by fingers—

 or like fringe, on the blue-green silk of a scarf

 being shaken out.

  

 It is hard to think of the time

 when a hand, puny and limp,

 will no longer be able to hold

 

 a comb, or a new stem;

 when hair thins and in clumps

 falls, and something to have

 been proud of once is lost—

  

 Like the old egret who stiffens

 at the lip of the estuary, eyes naked

 and large, bare head and neck turning

to salt, river and air meeting behind him.
