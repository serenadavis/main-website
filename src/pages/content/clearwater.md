it is fifty-fifty that she

 ever gets it back. in

 the gold room, the plaques

 were all late for us, leafy

 once, now fifty-plus

 years overdue. had we

 vaulted ourselves from the room, it

 might have thinned, anxious

 at the prospect of turn, of

 crawl, of smoothing

 that inability to burn. she

 pulls her tendons tight for

 the grass in these ways,

 knowing only glare and, twice,

 reflection. legs are

 sectioned, heaving under wrap. shoulders

 flake away in passing and

    are gutted in the lap.
