I don’t want to bring it up

 but I must bring it up

  

 when certain ghost seem

 to pass quiet as rain

  

 just before dawn

 how you wake

  

 to a wet lawn with no

 memory of the storm

  

 that’s what the blood

 is like, you point

  

 to it & ask how it got there

 you can’t imagine

  

 a storm you can’t see

 even if the winds

  

 are ripping my body

 into fifths, even if

  

 your body is the lightning

 I seek shelter from.

  

 if tomorrow is my turn

 to be the body on the news

  

 will you mourn me or

 blame me? will I be a tragedy

  

 or a tradition? will you

 retweet me? will you

  

 change your profile pic

 to my gentlest headshot?

  

 will you bother

 to learn my name?

  

 will you elegy me? am I

 the right shade of your mourning?

  

 do you only feel sadness

 when the victims are white?

  

 who do you pray for

 & what color is your god?

  

 do you believe God

 loves your country more?

  

 do your dreams taste like

 pie & oil & blood?

  

 tell me the difference

 amongst the bones
