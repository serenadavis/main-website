My part to play the princess:

  

 twenty-four folds of my whitest dress,

  

 field of dandelions flowering from my skin,

  

 dozen dozing doves to trim.

  

 Should they startle, I will be revealed.

  

 Where is my cloudy crown,

  

 my wreath of cotton? Garlanded body,

  

 I am entitled to more

  

 than downy dresses filled

  

 with seeds. For before the birds

  

 nested in my chest,

  

 rainwater fell from my face.

  

 I was not numinous,

  

 I was entirely clear.

  

 Now milk runs from me, for the birds

  

 to lap with their little tongues,

  

 for the weedy dandelions to wash in.

  

 Every recess preened:

  

 my part to play the princess.

  

 Now I am entitled to make

  

 a metaphor so white

  

 that you could whip through it

  

 like wind and fill the air

  

 with feathers or flowers.
